# Studio37 UX/UI, SEO, and Feature TODO

## Fresh Audit Backlog - June 11, 2026

### UI/UX

- [x] Audit the live CMS/page-builder homepage against the source fallback homepage so critical sections like package recommender, curated recent work, and service-area modules are guaranteed to render even when a stored layout exists.
- [x] Add a compact first-viewport "choose your path" module for Portrait, Wedding, Event, Commercial, and Branding so visitors can self-segment before reading long homepage copy.
- [x] Reduce homepage cognitive load by moving dense SEO copy below stronger scannable cards, FAQs, or accordions.
- [x] Add clear "starting at" pricing microcopy near every major service CTA, with a link to `/tools/pricing` or `/tools/package-recommender`.
- [x] Improve mobile sticky CTA behavior so the chatbot, save-quote popup, and sticky action bar never stack over each other on small screens.
- [x] Add visible active states and descriptive helper text for dropdown navigation on service and service-area menus.
- [x] Add service-specific "what to expect" cards above the fold on high-intent pages instead of relying only on long-form page copy.
- [x] Add trust proof near the booking form itself: review count, insurance/PPA, delivery timeline, and two-photographer promise.
- [x] Add a lightweight gallery handoff page or modal explaining that final galleries open on ShootProof at `https://gallery.studio37.cc`.

### SEO

- [x] Add `/tools/package-recommender` to the sitemap and required sitemap endpoint test coverage.
- [x] Add metadata and sitemap coverage for any future ShootProof handoff/gallery explainer page while keeping `/gallery` and `/portfolio` redirects out of the sitemap.
- [x] Recheck Netlify/Next sitemap cache behavior because live sitemap headers show very old cache age even when `lastmod` is current.
- [x] Add a deployment verification script that compares live sitemap URLs against `lib/sitemap-data.ts` required URLs after every push.
- [x] Add FAQ schema to package recommender, pricing, and session prep hub pages.
- [x] Add SoftwareApplication or WebApplication schema for `/tools/pricing` and `/tools/package-recommender`.
- [x] Add BreadcrumbList schema to pricing, package recommender, service-area index, and prep-guide pages.
- [x] Standardize local landing page canonical strategy so short city redirects and canonical destination pages cannot compete.
- [x] Add image metadata audit coverage for Cloudinary assets used in public conversion sections and recent-work cards.
- [x] Add internal links from top location pages to package recommender, pricing tool, and relevant prep guides.
- [x] Review title/meta uniqueness across generated city/service pages to reduce template similarity.
- [x] Add indexability checks for newly added tools and lead magnet pages in the admin SEO dashboard.

### Conversion And Lead Capture

- [x] Refine save-quote popup timing and triggers by page type, with less aggressive behavior on first-page visitors.
- [x] Add analytics events for package recommender selections, pricing duration changes, save-quote opens/submits/dismissals, and prep-guide downloads.
- [x] Send admin notifications with richer context from save-quote captures: page URL, selected package if present, calculator query params, and referrer.
- [x] Make the client-facing save-quote auto-response a dedicated template instead of reusing generic contact confirmation.
- [x] Add UTM/source capture to lead submissions and persist it in lead records.
- [x] Add calendar availability confidence near booking CTAs, even if the exact slot is selected later.
- [x] Add a "compare packages" CTA after blog posts and session-prep pages.

### Content And Public Features

- [x] Build the ShootProof-aware gallery launch page noted above, with expectations for downloads, favorites, sharing, print options, and client access.
- [x] Add curated recent-work management data in code or CMS so recent-work cards are not hard-coded in a component long term.
- [x] Create service-specific prep-guide download pages for Portrait, Wedding, Event, and Commercial instead of a single hub-only lead magnet.
- [x] Add "best locations for photos" sections for top markets: Pinehurst, The Woodlands, Conroe, Magnolia, Tomball, Spring, Montgomery, Bryan, and College Station.
- [x] Add venue-style examples for weddings and events without naming unsupported venues as partners.
- [x] Add a content block for turnaround expectations by service: sneak peeks, highlights, final gallery, rush options.
- [x] Add seasonal campaign pages for mini sessions, senior portraits, holiday parties, graduations, and brand refreshes.
- [x] Add testimonial modules mapped by service type instead of one generic testimonial pool.

### Admin And Operations

- [ ] Add a CMS/admin toggle to feature or reorder recent-work cards without editing code.
- [ ] Add an admin view for lead magnets showing guide requests, conversion source, and follow-up status.
- [ ] Add admin alerting when sitemap required URLs are missing from live production.
- [ ] Add a "public launch checklist" in admin for new pages: metadata, schema, sitemap, internal links, CTA, analytics event, and visual QA.
- [ ] Add a reusable email template specifically for saved quote follow-up.
- [ ] Add lead timeline events for package recommender selections and prep-guide downloads.

### Technical Quality And Performance

- [ ] Reduce homepage client JS by reviewing dynamic imports, page-builder hydration, and chatbot/save-quote mounting behavior.
- [ ] Add Playwright smoke tests for homepage, services, pricing, package recommender, session prep, locations, and booking.
- [ ] Add visual regression screenshots for mobile sticky CTA, save-quote popup, and navigation dropdowns.
- [ ] Add a link checker for internal public links plus expected external links to `https://gallery.studio37.cc`.
- [ ] Add automated checks for overlapping fixed UI elements on mobile.
- [ ] Add a production smoke test that fetches live headers for homepage, robots, sitemap, and top conversion pages after deploy.
- [ ] Review CSP differences between homepage HTML responses and static XML/text endpoints to keep security consistent without breaking analytics or widgets.

## Public Site UX/UI

- [x] Make location pages feel less templated with city-specific images, nearby venue examples, and service-specific internal links.
- [x] Improve portfolio/gallery calls-to-action so all public-facing gallery and portfolio links point to `https://gallery.studio37.cc`.

## Public Site Features

- [x] Build an interactive package recommender that routes users to booking with a prefilled package/service.

## Admin Dashboard UX/UI

- [x] Consolidate overlapping content/editor/page-builder tools into a clearer primary editing flow.
- [x] Add a unified command/search palette for leads, pages, galleries, settings, and admin tools.
- [x] Add a "today" operations view: new leads, stale follow-ups, upcoming appointments, campaigns due, broken SEO items.
- [x] Add clearer admin navigation grouping for content, gallery, CRM, marketing, SEO, and settings.
- [x] Add empty/loading/error states across admin dashboards that explain the next action.

- [x] Add gallery-subdomain link management for client galleries, share links, and gallery previews.
- [x] Add quick actions from lead records: send quote, schedule session, create gallery, send prep guide, request review.

## SEO

## Technical Quality

- [x] Work through the current repo-wide TypeScript backlog now that `tsconfig.json` checks source files.
- [x] Mark dynamic API routes explicitly dynamic where Next probes them during build.
- [x] Review CI configuration because GitHub Actions currently appears out of sync with the Netlify root app build.

## TypeScript Follow-Up

- [x] Repair `components/VisualEditor.tsx` builder schema drift and missing component type references.
